# WF-C

## Idea
Idea is to build a small representation of how wf-c works by showing a repeatable refreshable render
based on a template we build with the clicker at the start.

## Implementation
Currently looking to use piston to render, look at writing own wf-c implementation to run the bts

## Looks
Little window with square tiles, 512x512 window with 32px tiles, set of six colours, just to
illustrate.

## TODO:
 - Come up with a way to build examples for the seeds. IMPORTANT:
    > Opening to the program, build a clicker palette with clickable tiles. Keyboard input to change the four types.
    > Mountain (Dark GREY), Land (Brown), Coast (Sandy-yellow), Sea (Blue)
 - Implement wf-c logic behind the scenes in order to get single example working
 - Come up with easy interface to refresh render, swap between seeds.
