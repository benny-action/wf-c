# WF-C

## Idea
Idea is to build a small representation of how wf-c works by showing a repeatable refreshable render
based on a template we build with the clicker at the start.

## Looks
Little window with square tiles, 512x512 window with 32px tiles, set of six colours, just to
illustrate.

## TODO:
 - Implement wf-c logic behind the scenes in order to get single example working
 - Implement usage controls for wfc functions, way to visualise what is happening under the hood.
 - Run tests to confirm that what we want to happen is happening...



 MIGHT AS WELL:
 - Come up with easy interface to refresh render, swap between seeds.
