# WF-C

## Idea
Idea is to build a small representation of how wf-c works by showing a repeatable refreshable render
based on a few beginning examples.

## Implementation
Currently looking to use piston to render, look at writing own wf-c implementation to run the bts

## Looks
Little window with square tiles, 512x512 window with 32px tiles, set of six colours, just to
illustrate.

## TODO:
 - Implement colours and tiling system within. Accessible and easy to plug in further dtl
 - Implement wf-c logic behind the scenes in order to get single example working
 - Come up with a way to build examples for the seeds.
 - Come up with easy interface to refresh render, swap between seeds.
